I was a lecturer at the [First Italian Summer School of Geometric Deep Learning](https://www.sci.unich.it/geodeep2022/) alongside Michael Bronstein, Francesco Di Giovanni, Pim de Haan and Maurice Weiler. My lectures cover a large part of my upcoming PhD thesis on Topological Deep Learning and argue why topology should play a central role in GDL. The [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2-dEmQeTfRQXLKf9Fmlk3HmReGg3YZZ) and the [slides](https://www.sci.unich.it/geodeep2022/#schedule) are available online.
